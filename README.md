# Tail

Tail is a minimal Jekyll blog theme heavily based on [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) (and hence the name). Apart from the minor fixes to Tale and significant changes under the hood, this theme is designed to make it easier to maintain a blog.

If you already have a bunch of files in `*.md` format, you can simply copy them to the `_posts` folder after forking this theme and making a few changes to `_config.yml`, your blog is ready to go!

## What's new in Tail
- Dark Mode
- Support for posts without the `YYYY-MM-DD` in the post's filename
- Bi-directional Wiki-style linking support compatible with Obsidian (Planned)

## Features
- Easy installation
- Compatible with GitHub Pages
- Responsive design
- Pagination of posts
- Sticky posts
- Tags
- Excerpt management
