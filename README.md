</p>

Tail is a minimal Jekyll blog theme heavily based on [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) (and hence the name). Apart from the minor fixes to Tale and significant changes under the hood, this theme is designed to make it easier to maintain a blog.

If you already have a bunch of files in `*.md` format, you can simply copy them to the `_posts` folder after forking this theme and making a few changes to `_config.yml`, your blog is ready to go!
