This theme builds upon an amazing theme called [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale). Apart from the minor fixes to Tale, this theme is designed to make it easier to maintain a blog.

If you already have a bunch of files in `*.md` format, you can simply copy them to the `_posts` folder after forking this theme and making a few changes to `_config.yml`, your blog is ready to go!

Check out the key features [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/introducing-tail). If you liked this theme, do star it on [GitHub](https://github.com/jitinnair1/tail).
