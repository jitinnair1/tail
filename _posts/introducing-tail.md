How do take an already amazing theme like [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) and make it better? Dark-mode![^1] - well, that and many more changes under the hood is what led to this theme called Tail (as a hat tip to the original theme of course)

## What's new in Tail

- Dark Mode
- Popup [[footnotes|Footnotes]]
- Search (via [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app))
- Comment via [[reply-comments | reply by email]]
- Bi-directional Wiki-style linking support compatible with Obsidian
- Support for posts without the `YYYY-MM-DD` in post's filename and `lastmod` dates

## Some great features from the original Tale (with minor updates)
- Compatible with GitHub Pages
- Responsive design (looks just as good on mobile)
- Syntax highlighting
- Markdown and HTML text formatting
- Pagination of posts
- Sticky posts
- Tags
- Excerpt management

[^1]: There is no toggle button for the dark mode. This is by design. I wanted the dark-mode to be on if the browser or system level dark-mode is enabled.
