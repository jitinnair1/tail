Sticky, or pinned, posts are featured on the top of every page. Tale provides some flexibility when it comes to this feature.<!--more--> There is no limit on the number of sticky posts you can have. Although do note that each page will show all your sticky posts + the paginated posts. So if you have 4 sticky posts and 5 posts per page, each page can display up to 9 posts.

## Making a post "sticky"

Add `sticky: true` to the frontmatter of your blog post.

### Exclude sticky post from paginated posts

By default, sticky posts are still included in the paginated posts. To exclude a sticky post from paginated posts, add `hidden: true` to the frontmatter of that blog post.
